            <h1>HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN PUDDING</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <font size="5">
        1 (5-pound) whole chicken<br>
 
        4 carrots<br>
        4 celery ribs<br>
 
        1 large onion, quartered<br>
 
        1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>
 
        1 teaspoon pepper<br>
 
        6 tablespoons butter<br>
 
        1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules<br>
 
        1 teaspoon poultry seasoning<br>
 
        1/4 cup shortening<br>
 
        2 cups self-rising flour<br>
 
        3/4 cup milk<br>
 
        3 large eggs, lightly beaten<br>
 
        1 cup coarsely crushed saltine crackers (about 24 crackers)<br>
 
        1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted<br>

        <h2> How to Make It</h2>
        <font size="5">
        Step 1:<br>
        Combine first 6 ingredients and water to cover in a large Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour or until tender. Remove chicken and cool.<br>
        Step 2:<br>
        Pour 6 cups broth through a wire-mesh strainer into a large bowl, discarding solids. Reserve remaining broth for later use. Whisk 6 tablespoons butter, bouillon granules, and poultry seasoning into strained broth until smooth. Set aside to cool.<br>
        Step 3:<br>
        Cut shortening into flour with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Add milk, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Spread dough to a 1/2-inch thickness on a lightly greased baking sheet, forming 1 large hoecake.<br>
        Step 4:<br>
        Bake at 400° for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack; break into pieces.<br>
        Step 5:<br>
        Skin, bone, and coarsely chop chicken. Layer chicken and hoecake pieces in a lightly greased 13-x 9-inch baking dish. Whisk together chicken broth mixture and eggs; pour evenly over chicken and hoecake pieces.<br>
        Step 6:<br>
        Stir together cracker crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter; sprinkle evenly over top of chicken mixture.<br>
        Step 7:<br>
        Bake at 375° for 30 minutes or until golden brown and set. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.<br>
