        <b>HOW TO MAKE TURKISH CHICKEN PUDDING</b> 
    </h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <font size="5">
        *)1/2 fresh chicken breast<br>
        *)38 ounces (1 liter) whole milk<br>
        *)1/3 cup cornstarch<br>
        *)1/3 cup white rice flour<br>
        *)1 cup sugar<br>
        *)1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
        *)2 cups water<br>
        </font>
        </p>

<h2>Steps to Make It</h2>
<p>
    <font size="5">
step 1:<br>Start the day before you want to eat the pudding. First, place the chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover it. Bring it to a boil and cook the chicken well.<br>

step 2:<br>Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and put it in a bowl. Pull the meat apart with your fingers into fine strips. Continue to shred the chicken as finely as you can. You can use the tines of a fork to help. This should be easy if the chicken is cooked well.<br>

step 3:<br>Put the shredded chicken into a fine wire strainer and run it under cold water for several minutes. Rub the chicken shreds against the strainer while you rinse it using your hand or a wooden spoon.<br>

step 4:<br>Next, prepare a bowl of cold water. Place the strainer over it and soak the shredded chicken for about 20 minutes. Drain it in the strainer and repeat this process four or five times.<br>

step 5.<br>For the sixth time, place the strainer in the bowl of cold water and put the whole thing in the refrigerator and leave it overnight. The next morning, drain it, rinse it a few more times under running cold water, then drain the shredded chicken completely, squeezing out the extra water and setting it aside.<br>

step 6.<br>Put the milk in a large saucepan and boil it for several minutes. Add the shredded chicken to the milk and blend it with a hand blender two or three times until very smooth. Return the pan to the heat and continue to cook it for about 20 minutes more, stirring it constantly.<br>

step 7.<br>In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, rice flour, and about two cups of water until smooth. Remove the milk from the heat. Using your whisk, drizzle the starch in a very fine stream into the milk as you whisk it.<br>

step 8.<br>Once all the starch is whisked in, return the pan again to the heat and bring it to scalding temperature while stirring constantly. Cook it in this manner for about five minutes more until it begins to thicken.<br>

step 9.<br>Lastly, stir in the sugar and vanilla and cook it 15 minutes more. The pudding should become so thick that you can no longer stir it. Use the back of your wooden spoon to "slap" the surface to keep it moving as it cooks.<br>

step 10.<br>Wet the bottom and sides of a shallow glass tray. A rectangular oven casserole pan works well. Pour the pudding into the wet tray and let it cool down to room temperature. Cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about six hours.<br>

step 11.<br>You can cut your pudding or scoop it out with a large spoon. Sprinkle some cinnamon on each portion before serving.<br>
